# Speed Typing Practice App

## Overview

A web app written in React where you can practice speed typing whatever you want.

I made this because other websites that allow you to practice typing are very restrictive on what you can practice or are aimed towards beginners.
I wanted a way to paste in whatever text I wanted to; have it time me and track my mistakes; and finally, keep a highscore so I could challenge myself.
